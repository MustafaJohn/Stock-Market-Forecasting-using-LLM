# Stock-Market-Forecasting-using-LLM
This is a project which leverages machine learning models to predict stock market prices 

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for stock price forecasting by combining historical data, financial news sentiment analysis, and advanced predictive modeling. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, inference, and results visualization in an easy-to-use, reproducible pipeline.

## Prerequisites
- Python == 3.10.11
- Required libraries (install with pip install -r requirements.txt)

## Running the Forecasting Models
Each Python file in the project represents a day's rolling window implementation. To run any model go to each directory and run:
python filename

## Output Structure
After running any file, the results will be automatically saved in CSV format.

## Diebold-Mariano test
Each window has a Diebold Mariano test, which has the tests in a Jupyter notebook.

## Portfolio Analysis
Notebooks for portfolio analysis are also given in each directory. All it requires are the prediction csv files
